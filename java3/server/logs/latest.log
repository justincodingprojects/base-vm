[13:24:49] [Server thread/INFO]: [Server] and i'd like to let you know eaglercraft 1.13 will probably never exist
[13:24:54] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <[0;31;22m___[m> :([m

[13:25:02] [Server thread/INFO]: [Server] 1.12 maybe...1.13 forget about it
[13:26:16] [Server thread/INFO]: [Server] bc 1.13 has like 'The Flattening' which basically forces anyone who wants to make it to completely rewrite it
[13:27:00] [Server thread/INFO]: [Server] and if you don't know what 'The Flattening' is, basically a bunch of names and ids get switched around here and there

[13:27:26] [Server thread/INFO]: [Server] for the 1.9 and 1.11 remakes, you could just use 1.8.8 and add 1.9 and 1.11 features to it
[13:27:32] [Server thread/INFO]: [Server] you can't do the same for 1.13 tho
[13:27:58] [Server thread/INFO]: [Server] it took YEARS to make the original 1.5.2 eaglercraft
[13:28:16] [Server thread/INFO]: [Server] and thats while lax1dude (the owner) spent 6+ hours PER DAY
[13:28:46] [Server thread/INFO]: [Server] currently only 2-3 people are working on 1.12, but it's probably not going to be done until like 2025
